# Kohonen Neural Network
A Java library
--------------------------------------------------------
The network topology is defined by the number of neurons. 
The learning algorithm of the Kohonen Network uses euclidean distance as a metric 
 * Step1: Load input vector
 * Step2: Get best matching unit by calculating the minimal distance between a node's weight vector and the input vector
 * Step 3: The winning node learns the data (weight modification)
 * Step 4: Modify the neighbours weights(the learning fades as a gaussian func)
 * Repeat until number of iteration reached (no more learning vectors)

This library is made to communicate with the OMNet++ simulator via shared files. 
The network learns the data exchanged within a wireless sensor network for classifying. 
It can be used for other purpose if Ã¹odified a little bit.
